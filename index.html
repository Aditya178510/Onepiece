            <h1>About: </h1>
            <p><b>One Piece (ワンピース, Wan Pīsu?) is an animated series based on the manga of the same name, produced by Toei Animation and broadcasted by Fuji Television. Premiering in October 1999, it has currently aired over 1000 episodes (along with 15 theatrical films and many more TV specials and OVAs), and been exported to more than thirty nations worldwide.
            <br><br>Despite its prominence, it should be noted that the Toei anime is not the only—or first—animated adaptation of One Piece, being preceded by Production I.G's 1998 OVA Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack.
            <br><br>One Piece is divided into two halves: Sea of Survival: Super Rookies Saga (サバイバルの海 超新星編, Sabaibaru no Umi: Chōshinsei-hen?), and The Final Sea: The New World Saga (最後の海 新世界編, Saigo no Umi: Shinsekai-hen?).[1] One Piece is one of the most popular series in the world, and currently, its anime can be watched on a plethora of streaming sites, including Crunchyroll, Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Vudu, Pluto, Apple TV, and Sling TV. </b></p>
